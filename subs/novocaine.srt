You can’t let your

You got to wear it
like a badge of honor.

00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:35,660
You got to go out there
and you gotta say,

"World, this is me. This is

Here at San
Diego Trust Credit Union,

24
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:25,188
we don’t have customers

25
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:28,583
or clients. We have members.

26
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:30,846
Family members.

27
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,108
And that’s...

28
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,588
exciting!

29
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:37,156
Yeah, big time. Yes! Yeah.

30
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:39,115
And there’s nothing

31
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:42,336
more exciting than
Christmas bonus day.

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,338
Our busiest day of the year.

33
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,383
The day hard-working
union members

34
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:49,299
get to turn their
labor into holiday joy.

35
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,835
Because tomorrow,
we put the "trust"

36
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:05,837
in San Diego Trust.

37
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:09,145
And that’s it. All
right, that’s it.

38
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,365
Nice. Powerful.

39
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,454
Yeah, great job. Good stuff.

40
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,586
Right, back to
work. Back to work.

41
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,634
Right.

42
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:24,029
And what about the store?
Are you, are you getting by?

43
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:26,815
Had to let Terrance go.

44
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:30,122
But I still open every day.

45
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,994
Not sure what else
to do with myself

46
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,691
now that Betty’s gone.

47
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:41,090
Earl, I’m...

48
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:43,658
I’m really sorry,
but if you can’t pay,

49
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:45,032
we’re gonna have to foreclose.

50
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,665
I understand.

51
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:02,285
Okay.

52
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,113
What I can do

53
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,724
is I can hold on to this
paperwork until after the holiday.

54
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:09,179
That should buy you enough time
for Betty’s Social Security

55
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,946
and retirement to clear probate.

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,514
Now, I can’t promise that
it’ll save the store, but...

57
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,995
that should keep
you in your house.

58
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,954
I appreciate that.

59
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:24,699
Let me walk you out, okay?

60
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,356
I’m so sorry again, Earl.

61
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,183
I mean, I can’t even imagine

62
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,969
what it’s like to lose someone
after 50 years of marriage.

63
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,364
Time don’t matter.

64
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:41,542
Would’ve hurt just as bad if
I lost her the day we met.

65
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,372
She brought the
sunshine in my life.

66
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,071
Know what I mean?

67
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,682
Yeah.

68
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:54,163
Totally.

69
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:16,577
Hey, Nate? Oh.

70
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,970
Hi! Hey, what’s up? Oh,
my God! I’m so sorry.

71
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:20,581
Oh, no. That’s fine. Jesus!

72
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,472
I can take care of that.
Holy shit. I’m sorry.

73
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,062
No, really, you don’t have to.

74
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:26,238
I’m actually really good
at getting stains out.

75
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:27,955
You actually don’t have to.
I’m good. I’ll take care of it.

76
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,720
I promise. Everything’s...
Do not worry.

77
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,244
I, uh...

78
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:34,943
Uh, I...

79
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,553
I go... I have to,
uh, go.

80
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:37,772
Sorry. Oh.

81
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:43,386
Real smooth, idiot.

82
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:47,085
Yeah, come in. Hey.

83
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,087
Sherry! Hey! Hi.

84
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:51,263
Hi. Um...

85
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:54,484
Am I just so very
fired?

86
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:56,201
I know I’ve only worked
here for four months,

87
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:58,270
but I really feel like I
have a lot to contribute.

88
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:01,273
No, no, you’re not fired. You’re
definitely not fired. Are you sure?

89
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,251
Yeah. I feel like I at
least owe you a new shirt.

90
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:06,496
Oh, this shirt? No.
No, no, no. This is...

91
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,107
It’s the worst shirt I have.

92
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:11,109
Okay. Well, maybe I
could take you to lunch?

93
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:12,546
Uh, yeah.

94
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,025
Uh, no, actually.

95
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,027
Sorry, I brought mine
today, so I’m okay.

96
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,682
Okay. Yeah. No pressure.

97
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:21,511
Okay. But if you change
your mind, let me know.

98
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,905
Bye.

99
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,181
Hey, uh...

100
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:40,443
You know what?

101
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,664
I’m in. Okay.

102
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:47,102
Cool. Leave in ten?
Yeah! Sounds good.

103
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:48,973
Looking forward to it!

104
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:50,932
Don’t say that so loud.

105
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,157
Oh.
Welcome back, honey.

106
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,159
I see you’ve brought
a friend this time.

107
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,465
Yeah, this is Nate.

108
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,336
Hey there, Nate.
What can I get you?

109
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:07,731
Oh, you know, just a milkshake,
please. Vanilla milkshake.

110
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,255
You don’t want any food? They
have really good sandwiches.

111
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,170
Really good sandwiches? Uh...

112
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,476
Nah. I’m good.

113
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,132
Okay. Um... Then I’ll have...

114
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:19,482
Oh! Please tell me you’re
not out of the cherry pie.

115
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,179
It’s your lucky day.

116
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:22,354
Got one left. Oh, yes!

117
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:28,099
So...

118
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:32,103
what’s your deal?

119
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:34,236
Uh...

120
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,021
My deal? Yeah.

121
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:38,457
You’re just always, like,

122
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:39,937
I don’t know, in your office

123
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:41,808
and you never come out
to the happy hours.

124
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:45,900
I don’t really know.
You know? I’m, um...

125
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:50,078
I guess I’m just not really
a... very social person.

126
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:52,950
Okay.Yeah.

127
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:57,738
Do you have a girlfriend?
No. No, I don’t. Um, not...

128
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:59,391
Not right now.

129
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,611
Are you on the
apps? No! God, no.

130
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,787
Why not? Really?
You’d do great.

131
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,801
I could take a profile
picture of you right now.

132
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,095
The reindeer tie would slay.

133
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,097
Oh, okay. All right.

134
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,665
Thank you very much.

135
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,581
Enjoy. Holler if
you need anything.

136
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,104
Thank you.

137
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,977
Mmm! Mm-hmm.

138
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,546
Oh, my God! This
is so good. Cool.

139
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,114
Do you want some?
Oh, no, I’m okay.

140
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,551
You should have a bite.
I’m good. No, I’m...

141
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,485
Really, Sherry, I’m
fine. Take a little bite.

142
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,164
It’s so good. I can’t.
I can’t! I can’t.

143
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:37,385
I’m sorry. I just
can’t have any pie.

144
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,999
What do you mean, you can’t?

145
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:44,001
Uh...

146
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,873
Okay, um...

147
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:50,747
I have a genetic disorder.

148
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,880
Oh.

149
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,535
Okay.

150
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,582
Go on. Oh.

151
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,192
Yeah, um...

152
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:03,717
It’s called CIPA.

153
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:07,851
Congenital Insensitivity
to Pain with Anhidrosis.

154
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,374
Um...

155
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,376
It affects my nervous system.

156
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,204
And it, uh...

157
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:16,381
basically makes it
so I can’t feel pain.

158
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,557
Um...

159
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,297
Or hot or cold.

160
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:21,865
And that’s why I
can’t have the pie.

161
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,738
Or any solid food,
really, because...

162
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,176
unknowingly I could...

163
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,657
bite my tongue off.

164
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:33,224
Oh, the coffee earlier.

165
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:36,576
Yeah, I couldn’t
feel that at all.

166
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,752
Holy shit! Yeah.

167
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:40,535
You’re a superhero.

168
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,234
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

169
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:46,498
I have the power
to step on a nail,

170
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,414
and not know until my
shoe fills up with, uh...

171
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,025
blood.

172
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,245
Right. Didn’t think about that.

173
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,833
True story, by the way. We were
at the aquarium, my mom fainted.

174
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:57,945
Jesus.Yeah.

175
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,121
My parents, they, um...

176
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:03,254
They basically spent my entire
childhood at the hospital.

177
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:04,604
And then when they found out

178
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,127
that the average life expectancy

179
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:09,957
for my condition was, um, 25,

180
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,742
they sort of locked me up.

181
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:16,528
I’m sorry.

182
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,444
No, hey, I’m, you know, I’m...

183
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,838
I’m still kicking.

184
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,885
Okay. I mean, I
hear all that...

185
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,820
but does that really
mean that you can’t have

186
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,890
just a little bite of this pie?

187
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,979
No. Can’t. I mean...

188
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,503
Like I said, I could
bite my tongue off.

189
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,548
You’re not gonna bite
your tongue off, Nate.

190
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:39,334
This is the best cherry pie
on the west coast, okay?

191
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:40,683
I swear to God.

192
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,734
Listen. If anything goes
wrong, I’m right here.

193
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:55,915
Okay.

194
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:57,569
Okay?

195
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:01,312
Here we go. Taking
a bite. Yep.

196
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:03,010
Open your mouth.

197
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:04,533
Okay.

198
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,884
Remember, chew softly. Yep.

199
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:11,453
Uh-huh. Let the magic happen.

200
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:16,850
Uh-huh.

201
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,118
My God, that is
so good!

202
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,861
That is so good. Oh, my God!

203
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,951
Oh, my God! Wha...
Yeah, I told you.

204
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,648
What?

205
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,129
This is pie? This
is pie. Yeah!

206
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:36,826
Pie’s good.

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,175
Congratulations.

208
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,394
Whoa!

209
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,399
What are you doing
later tonight?

210
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,926
Look, she invited
me out to this art show.

211
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,233
I’m
just not gonna go.

212
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:55,366
I think I’m just gonna stay here
and we’ll play, and it’ll be fine.

213
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,518
You’ve been talking
about this girl for months.

214
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,979
You’re basically
in love with her.

215
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,937
If I were you, I’d be
all over that shit!

216
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,504
But I’m not like you.

217
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,593
I’m not cool. I
don’t drive a Harley.

218
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,682
I’m not this hunky
guy with a man bun.

219
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:08,553
Again,
it’s a short pony.

220
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,808
But dude, that stuff is not
why I do well with women.

221
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:12,993
Does it help? Of course it
does, I’m not gonna lie.

222
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,995
But confidence is king!

223
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,128
I feel like I’m gonna
mess it up somehow.

224
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:20,174
What’s the
worst that can happen?

225
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:22,588
You wind up alone in your
living room playing video games?

226
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:27,181
You’re already there, my guy!
What do you have to lose?

227
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,883
Nate, you’re gonna die. What?

228
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,711
Oh, shit. Sorry. Um...

229
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,626
Ah, okay.

230
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,716
No, no, no, that was
actually really impressive.

231
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,389
I’m sorry, my head’s
not in this right now.

232
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,067
Can I call you back
a little later?

233
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,479
Oh, sure, yeah.
I’ll just go fuck myself.

234
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,114
Okay, thanks.

235
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,723
Boo! Hey! Hi.

236
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,117
Hey. You came,
you’re here. Yeah!

237
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,120
No, of course. You know,
my schedule cleared up

238
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,055
and, uh, yeah. Cool. Well,
I’m glad you’re here.

239
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:41,211
Yeah, of course.
What do you think?

240
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:42,822
These are yours? Mm-hmm.

241
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,173
These are awesome.
Oh, thank you.

242
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,479
Who are they?

243
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,525
Um, they’re from
my therapy group.

244
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,006
Some cutters, some suicidal.

245
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,747
Everyone’s kind of
recovering in their own way.

246
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:58,359
Jesus, you run a
therapy group, too? Huh.

247
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,535
Oh. No,
no, no. I attend it.

248
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,102
Oh. Oh.

249
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,322
Damn, I’m so... I’m sorry.

250
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:08,325
No, no, no. Don’t
apologize. I did not mean...

251
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,631
You’re okay, it’s fine. Okay.

252
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:11,024
I’m not ashamed of it. Okay.

253
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,548
Oh, wait, you have
a... Oh, God!

254
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,030
I sold one. Yeah.

255
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,727
Why are you so surprised?

256
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:21,556
Come on.

257
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:23,819
Oh, yeah.

258
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:28,302
Um... So, where’d you grow up?

259
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:31,653
Well, I grew up in Tucson.

260
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,698
And Cedar City.

261
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,049
And Sacramento.

262
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,094
Hmm.

263
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,096
I was in foster
care. Okay, yeah.

264
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,056
So I just kind of bounced
around until I was twelve

265
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,709
and then I got adopted.

266
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,929
And I had, you know, uh,

267
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:49,801
my own room and a big
brother and parents.

268
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,629
And it was all very exciting.

269
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:53,849
That’s amazing! Do you
still see them a lot?

270
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,634
Not really, no.

271
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,201
Um...

272
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,812
It wasn’t exactly
a loving household.

273
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:02,509
Okay. Yeah.

274
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:04,033
Yeah. So, I, uh...

275
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:06,557
left when I was eighteen,

276
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,091
and I’ve been on
my own ever since.

277
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:12,215
Man, that is tough. I’m sorry.

278
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:14,086
It’s fine.

279
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,479
You know,

280
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,873
if you don’t have
anybody you care about,

281
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,353
it’s harder to get hurt, right?

282
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,095
Novocaine?

283
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,490
Holy shit.

284
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,231
It is you!

285
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:30,146
I mean... This
is fucking wild.

286
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,626
I...

287
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,933
I thought
you’d be dead by now.

288
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,065
Yeah, well...

289
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,285
I’m not. Yeah!

290
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,895
Good for you, bro.

291
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,247
Just like old times, huh?

292
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,814
It’s fucking Novocaine!

293
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,598
And he’s not fucking dead!

294
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,601
So who was that?

295
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,387
Oh. Uh, that was, um...

296
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,737
some asshole that I went
to middle school with.

297
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,915
And what did he
call you? Novocaine?

298
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,310
Yeah, uh, it was...

299
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,140
It was just some dumb
nickname they gave me.

300
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:10,970
You know, once the other kids
found out about my condition,

301
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:14,538
they basically started kicking
my ass pretty much daily,

302
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:16,366
figuring it didn’t
matter, you know,

303
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,152
because I couldn’t
feel any of it, so...

304
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:23,852
I’m sorry.

305
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,029
Yeah. But...

306
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:30,859
I got to say, as far
as nicknames go...

307
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,079
"Novocaine"?

308
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,560
Kind of badass. No.

309
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,780
Really? Yeah! Yeah.

310
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:41,696
Okay, well, thank you,
but they didn’t think so.

311
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,090
It-it... It was
fine.

312
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:49,486
S-Sorry. Um, excuse me for
one second. I’m just gonna...

313
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:52,533
Hey!

314
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,100
Yeah?

315
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,711
What is the deal with the alarm?

316
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,104
Yeah, um...

317
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,257
I got to set one of
these every three hours

318
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,239
or else my bladder
might explode.

319
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,810
Other kids had a blast with
that one, too. Trust me.

320
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,534
You’re so funny. Yeah,
I like to think I am.

321
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,101
World-traveling
kinda guy. Hey.

322
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,669
Glad you two are getting along.

323
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:43,888
We really are. He’s hilarious.

324
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:46,761
You know what?

325
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,329
I think you two just need
to let bygones be bygones.

326
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:50,852
What do you say?

327
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:54,812
What do you mean? Shots! Duh!

328
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,119
Come on. My treat.

329
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,774
Yeah, sure, why not?
Nice. Okay, great.

330
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,168
Hey, and, uh, no
hard feelings, right?

331
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,953
Yeah, sure.

332
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,479
"Feelings." Get it?

333
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:12,091
That’s so clever.
This fucking guy.

334
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:14,919
There you go.

335
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,486
Thank you.

336
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,053
Here you go.

337
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:29,891
What the fuck was that?

338
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:33,068
Yeah, what is that?

339
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:36,550
Leapin’ Larry’s Five
Alarm Ghost Pepper Sauce.

340
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:39,683
Do you like it?

341
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:43,470
Yeah, it’s Novocaine’s favorite.

342
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:51,217
Hey, should we, um,
head back to your place?

343
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,044
You can put those on his tab.

344
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:54,872
No! Done.

345
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:59,573
That was amazing. That was...

346
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:02,445
You’re a very good
actor. Oh, thank you.

347
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,230
Oh, my God. That’s
got to be killing him

348
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,580
thinking that I’m
taking you home.

349
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:09,322
But you are.

350
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:11,585
Wait, what?

351
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:20,942
Have you really read
all these books?

352
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:24,424
I don’t get out much.

353
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:27,209
Really? You’ve
even read the...

354
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:30,081
Mayo Clinic A-to-Z Health Guide?

355
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:33,389
When you can, um, impale
yourself without realizing it,

356
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:34,782
uh, you know,

357
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:37,132
first aid knowledge
comes in pretty handy.

358
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:38,742
Touché.

359
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,965
You’re a real Renaissance
man, Nathan Caine.

360
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:47,621
I never would’ve guessed.

361
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,718
Hi. Hello.

362
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,243
What else are you hiding?

363
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,073
Sorry.No.

364
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,466
No, I’m sorry. Uh...

365
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:08,729
It’s okay.

366
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,905
You sure? Yeah.

367
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:24,397
Is there more?

368
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,923
There’s a bit more, yeah.

369
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:39,847
Whoa.

370
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:44,068
Nate, what the...

371
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,854
What the fuck? Who are you?

372
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:49,335
These are amazing. Where
did you get them done?

373
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:50,597
Uh...

374
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,253
I did them myself.
No, did you really?

375
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:55,950
Yeah. How long
did that take you?

376
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:57,430
Um...

377
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,780
Well, it started when
I was a teenager and...

378
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,477
as I got better at it,

379
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,393
I kind of got more sucked
into it, and it was, uh...

380
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,614
It was just like, um,

381
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:11,008
this secret world.

382
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,227
This...

383
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:15,448
This other life that,

384
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:18,102
you know, was
actually an adventure.

385
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,757
It’s a story, isn’t it?

386
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:24,195
Yeah. Yeah, you could...

387
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,241
You could call it that, yeah.

388
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:29,853
How does it end?

389
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:32,769
I don’t know. Um...

390
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,381
I’m still figuring that out.

391
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:39,994
So, I have a question.

392
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,565
If you can’t feel pain,

393
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:51,397
does that also mean
that you can’t feel...

394
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,094
pleasure?

395
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,103
I mean, uh...

396
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:04,366
I think I can.

397
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:08,196
Can you feel this?

398
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,855
I feel a little bit of pressure.

399
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:17,597
Okay.

400
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:20,295
How about this?

401
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,870
Definitely feeling something.

402
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:51,892
You’re...

403
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:53,937
gorgeous.

404
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:59,116
It’s not just you, Nate.

405
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:02,729
Everybody is hiding something.

406
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,254
I think we’re all just...

407
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,824
looking for someone
we can show it to.

408
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,537
Yes!

409
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,636
Sorry!

410
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:49,575
"Hey, Sherry, so last
night was life-changing."

411
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:52,012
No, no, no. Way too big. Uh...

412
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,405
"Last night was really great."

413
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,581
Uh...

414
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,148
"Last night was...

415
00:24:58,322 --> 00:24:59,672
amazing."

416
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:06,069
Ho, ho, ho!

417
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:07,722
Ah, gentlemen.

418
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:09,420
Love the outfits.

419
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:11,205
How can I help you?

420
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:12,659
We’re here to make a withdrawal.

421
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:16,449
Get down on the fucking ground!

422
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,429
Get down! Get down!

423
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,823
Get on the fucking
ground!

424
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:22,932
- Take the back!
- Get on the ground!

425
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:25,262
Get down! All right, everyone.

426
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:27,569
Do exactly as we say

427
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,615
and you’ll all live to
open up your presents.

428
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,966
Phones on the ground
in front of you!

429
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,663
Hands behind your heads!

430
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,580
Mr. Manager...

431
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:39,755
...you’re up.

432
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,154
Alarm’s tripped!

433
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:48,547
Three minutes!

434
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,508
Open the vault.

435
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,042
I won’t be able to
open it in time.

436
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:56,555
2:45.

437
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,645
Open the vault or
I will kill you.

438
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:05,085
No. I won’t do it.

439
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:09,350
He won’t do it.

440
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:11,308
Man called my bluff.

441
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:17,488
I...

442
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:19,229
asked you...

443
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,101
very nicely!

444
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,368
Captain Kringle? Huh?

445
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:28,674
Your beard.

446
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,771
Sorry, buddy.

447
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,120
You saw my face.

448
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:46,256
Assistant manager!

449
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,869
Your turn!

450
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:55,788
Two minutes.

451
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,272
Combination!

452
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,015
Say the fucking combination!

453
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:09,323
What the fuck is wrong with you?

454
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:10,977
1:30.

455
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,761
Hey. Hey. Hmm.

456
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:14,154
Look at me.

457
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,766
Say the fucking numbers.

458
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,941
Wha... What?

459
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,821
No, no, no!

460
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:31,780
Don’t.

461
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,129
Huh.

462
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,610
Okay. Have it your way.

463
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,307
Wait, hey, hey.

464
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,440
Wait! Wait! Wait! No!

465
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:41,181
Don’t! Stop, stop, stop!

466
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:43,009
Okay,
here’s the deal.

467
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:45,098
Open the vault or I
open her brain pan.

468
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:46,490
Okay, okay.

469
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,185
Three, two, one.
Okay! I’m telling you!

470
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,756
I’m telling you! Stop
it! I’m telling you!

471
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:55,543
01-32-26.

472
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,681
Was that so hard?

473
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:12,473
Come on,
come on, come on.

474
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,478
Holy shit.

475
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:19,698
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

476
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,573
Come to me, baby.

477
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,402
Cops are here early!

478
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:29,925
Go. Let’s move it!

479
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:31,448
Take the bag! He’s
got the other.

480
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,233
Let’s move!

481
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:34,974
Grab a
fucking hostage.

482
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,671
Sorry, sweetheart.

483
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,718
Come on.

484
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,200
Here we go. Don’t
fucking look at me!

485
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,508
Merry Christmas.

486
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:51,773
All right, three,
two, one. Move!

487
00:28:58,127 --> 00:28:59,520
Guns on the ground!

488
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:02,436
Okay! Okay.

489
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:04,525
Just take it easy.

490
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:10,574
Nobody
needs to get hurt.

491
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,750
Go.

492
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:02,191
Hurry up, asshole! Let’s go!

493
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:13,507
Sherry.

494
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:41,578
Help me.

495
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:47,322
Damn it.

496
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,717
All right.

497
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:53,981
Hey, hey.

498
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:55,765
You’re gonna be okay.

499
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,894
All right?

500
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,769
Just keep pressure on it.

501
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:02,208
32 and
34, backup eight minutes out.

502
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,297
Eight minutes?

503
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:13,610
Don’t.

504
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,832
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

505
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:19,878
I will bring it back. Come on!

506
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:22,750
Oh, my God, what am I doing?

507
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,124
Hey, you good?

508
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:51,735
Good?

509
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,790
I’m better than good.
We’re rich, motherfuckers!

510
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,087
It’s not about the money.

511
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,393
What is important
is that we had fun.

512
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:03,878
Aw, fuck, I’m going fast.

513
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
Guys?

514
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,840
We’ve got company.

515
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:11,930
These fucking cops!

516
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:16,543
Oh, fuck!

517
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:23,985
Okay. Okay. You’re okay.

518
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,160
You’re okay, you’re okay.

519
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:32,994
Fuck, he’s still coming!

520
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:34,604
What’s your fucking
call, genius?

521
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,519
Split up. Meet
back at the shop.

522
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:38,173
Get on the highway.
No, no, no.

523
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:39,977
Ain’t getting on the
highway. Get on the highway.

524
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,109
I want to stay
there. He needs us.

525
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,439
Do it! He’s...

526
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:47,182
Come on. Which one, Sherry?

527
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:54,711
Please be the one.
Please be the one.

528
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:01,022
Shit! Jesus!

529
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,503
Oh, shit!

530
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,292
What the fuck?

531
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:13,619
Hey, are you okay?

532
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:14,643
Sorry. No, I’m sorry.

533
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:16,037
Where you going?

534
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:18,953
Out of the way!

535
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:20,302
Fuck off!

536
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:29,616
Oh, hey, hey. Hey, look.

537
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,430
Look, I don’t want any trouble. I
just want to know where Sherry is.

538
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:33,663
Wait.

539
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
You’re not a cop?

540
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,754
Uh, no, but...

541
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:39,930
Come on, man.
Just tell me where she is.

542
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,455
I’ll
let you go. Okay?

543
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,982
You ever fired a gun before?

544
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:55,381
Do you, uh... even know
where the safety is? Hmm?

545
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:56,773
Mm-hmm.

546
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:04,651
Hey, wait!

547
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:13,007
Hey, man.

548
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:14,724
I don’t want to fight, okay?
I’m not that guy. I just want...

549
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,802
Get the fuck out
of my way. Move!

550
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:31,634
You’re fucking
dead, you know that?

551
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,213
Just tell me. Please.

552
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:48,824
Motherfuck...

553
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:51,855
Okay, so those are
definitely third degree,

554
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:53,806
so you’re gonna want to
run it under some cool...

555
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:56,616
I’m not done with you.

556
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,879
Okay, wait, hold
on. Come here.

557
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,621
Look, I still feel like we can
both get what we want here.

558
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,666
Oh, you’re
strong!

559
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:11,239
Ooh, I am so sorry.

560
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,426
Hey, last chance.

561
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,125
Tell me where
she is. Eat shit.

562
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:36,569
Okay, okay. Uh...

563
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:42,879
Come here!

564
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:08,601
You don’t have, like,
a gluten thing, do you?

565
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,110
Hey.

566
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:42,461
Hey, man, you okay?

567
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:59,173
Oh, shit. Okay, okay.

568
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:00,827
You had to do it.
You had to do it.

569
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,220
Think about Sherry.

570
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:23,284
"At work."

571
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,068
At work.

572
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,636
Um...

573
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,942
Hey, what?

574
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,124
Okay, okay.

575
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:41,867
All right.

576
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:17,251
I’m sorry,
so Sherry was kidnapped

577
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,818
and you killed a
guy in a kitchen?

578
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,578
Roscoe, just listen
to me very carefully.

579
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:22,691
I don’t have a lot of...
Oh, my God, I got shot.

580
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:24,452
What, you
got shot? Just listen.

581
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,565
I just texted you a
photo of a tattoo.

582
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,859
I need you to call around
to every parlor in San Diego

583
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:30,402
and try to find out
who did the art.

584
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:31,807
What am I,
your fucking secretary?

585
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,311
I’m not doing shit!

586
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,376
Roscoe, I wouldn’t ask if
I had any other choice.

587
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,520
I mean, we’re a team, right?

588
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:37,815
Yes, a
video game team.

589
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:39,447
We’ve never even met in person.

590
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:42,363
And now you’re involving
me in a real-life murder?

591
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:43,862
Why don’t you just
call the police?

592
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:46,193
You know, I technically
stole a cop car.

593
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,563
Then there’s the whole thing
about the guy that I killed.

594
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:50,565
Fine. Jesus.
I’ll get you the address,

595
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:51,589
but that’s it, okay?

596
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,765
Okay, thank you!

597
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:53,940
Thank you, bye.

598
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:06,169
Details are
still trickling in,

599
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,129
but we have confirmed reports
of multiple fatalities.

600
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:10,503
Citizens are advised to report

601
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:12,785
any suspicious
activity in their area

602
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:15,048
but to not engage with
possible suspects.

603
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,022
Shit. Bad
week to quit drinking.

604
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:20,314
You quit drinking?

605
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,577
No, no. I just
mean it would be.

606
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,492
Detective! Yeah,
what do you got?

607
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:25,786
There’s three officers down.

608
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,234
One in the ICU.

609
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,802
Bank manager DOA inside.

610
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,717
Three gunmen, two cars.

611
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,458
They took a hostage with them.

612
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,416
And one additional
suspect at large.

613
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,591
Additional suspect?

614
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:38,680
Yeah, the assistant manager.

615
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,987
He stole a cruiser and
followed the gunmen.

616
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:43,381
Witnesses say it’s the same
guy who opened the vault.

617
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:46,427
Could be a double-cross.

618
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:48,821
Do we have units in pursuit?

619
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:50,779
No, these were the
only ones in the area.

620
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:52,477
Calls went out to
the Fifth and Sixth,

621
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:54,827
but they’re spread thin
’cause of the holidays.

622
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:57,046
Okay, thank you,
Officer. Thank you.

623
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:03,139
We need to get a file on that
assistant manager, quick.

624
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:04,753
Today was supposed
to be an easy one.

625
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
I’m going.Thanks.

626
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:09,971
I’m going.

627
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:12,714
Coming through,
newsies! Out of my way!

628
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:13,889
Come on.

629
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:52,145
Closed for lunch!
Come back later!

630
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:55,278
Hmm.

631
00:40:57,803 --> 00:41:00,022
Hey! It’s me! Nate!

632
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:01,676
What
in the Sam Hill?

633
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,809
From the bank.
Could you let me in?

634
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,464
Hi.

635
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:14,361
You sure you don’t want me to
just call you an ambulance?

636
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:15,951
Uh, no. I told you.
There’s no time.

637
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:18,257
All right.

638
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:20,956
Sweet Jesus!

639
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,436
Here we go.

640
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:30,966
Earl, you okay? Me?
Oh, yeah, just...

641
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,752
This was not what
I expected today.

642
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,754
Hey, if it’s any
consolation, me neither.

643
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:38,191
All right.

644
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,019
All right.

645
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,151
If I can find it.

646
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,113
Huh. Is that it?

647
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,596
Hey! There we go. Ah!

648
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:54,903
All right.

649
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:58,907
Just some of this.

650
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:00,996
Just a little bit.

651
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:04,130
Okay.

652
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:05,827
Here we go.

653
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,614
Yeah. There we go, see?

654
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,530
Good as new.

655
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:15,271
Oh, whoa. Um...

656
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:16,969
Earl, was there...

657
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:18,860
There’s an
EpiPen in there, right?

658
00:42:18,884 --> 00:42:20,233
You mind handing that to me?

659
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:22,931
What? You allergic
to something?

660
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,542
Um, thank you, no, uh...

661
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:26,587
epinephrine’s just another
form of adrenaline.

662
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:29,851
It should, uh, keep
me from passing out.

663
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:37,206
Yeah, that did it.

664
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,165
Okay.

665
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:44,170
Yeah, all right. Hey, Earl.

666
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:45,911
Thank you so much.
Sorry, this was...

667
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,564
a lot.

668
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,567
You go get that girl, Nate.

669
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:54,441
Oh, hey, um...

670
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:59,228
Almost forgot. This should help
with the mortgage for a while.

671
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:04,059
Betty always said
you were a good kid.

672
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:10,065
Oh! Sorry.

673
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:13,765
All right, uh,
I’ll see you later.

674
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:15,505
You know, if I...
If I don’t, uh, die.

675
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,648
You might want to
launder that, by the way.

676
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:29,607
Ah.

677
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:09,274
One
of our bank robbers?

678
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:11,039
God, I hope so.

679
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:13,563
Be a shame if it
was the real Santa.

680
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:18,177
Kitchen staff said a crazy
guy in a tie did all this.

681
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:21,310
I’m thinking that’s
our assistant manager.

682
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:23,312
Oh, speaking of...

683
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:27,621
Got a bit of a profile on him.

684
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,017
Uh, Nathan Caine.

685
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:34,062
Single. Male. Thirty.

686
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:36,151
No record. No affiliations.

687
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:38,284
Zero traffic tickets.

688
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:42,070
An online gamer tag
of "Magicnateball."

689
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,682
Oh, that’s good. Uh...

690
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:48,076
Worked at San Diego
Trust for six years.

691
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,775
That just doesn’t sound like
a stone-cold killer to me.

692
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:52,864
And yet...

693
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:55,823
Yeah.

694
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,783
Do you have a cell
phone number for him?

695
00:44:58,957 --> 00:45:01,699
Guy just robbed a
bank, killed a guy.

696
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:03,851
Do you really think he’s just
picking up his cell phone?

697
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:08,140
This is Nate speaking.
Hi, Nate.

698
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:10,272
Uh, this is Detective
Barbara Mincy

699
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:12,187
of the San Diego Police.

700
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:13,580
How you doing?

701
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:15,034
I’ve... I’ve been better.

702
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:16,452
Did you catch the others?

703
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:18,672
Is Sherry, the
hostage, is she safe?

704
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:20,805
Yeah, well, you know,
we’re working on that.

705
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:23,261
But whatever it is you’re doing
isn’t making our job easier.

706
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:25,679
So if you could turn yourself
and the cash in right now...

707
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,420
Whoa, wait, wait, sorry. Um...

708
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:31,859
Holy shit. You think
I’m in on this.

709
00:45:32,033 --> 00:45:34,359
No, no, Nate, uh, we’re
just following the facts here.

710
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:37,386
Look, hey, I don’t give a shit about
the money. I just want to save Sherry.

711
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,825
Mm-hmm. Well, that’s our job
to worry about, not yours.

712
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:43,305
Yeah, well, I heard that
75% of hostages who die

713
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:45,394
are killed in the first
three hours, so...

714
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:47,285
Unless you’re calling me
to tell me you found her,

715
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:48,528
I’m not gonna stop.

716
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:50,356
This Sherry...

717
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:53,446
She, uh, she your girlfriend?

718
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,665
Yeah, I mean, you know,
we haven’t necessarily

719
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,711
put a label on anything
yet, but the...

720
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,689
Stop it, all right? I know
what you’re trying to do.

721
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:00,953
You don’t give a shit about us.

722
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:02,368
No, Nate, that’s not true.

723
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,979
We just want everyone
to get home safe, okay?

724
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,348
I understand you care
about her, but...

725
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:07,416
Do you?

726
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,639
Do you know what it’s like to wait
your whole life to meet someone?

727
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:15,947
Someone who changes
everything? Who...

728
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:19,341
finally gives your life meaning?

729
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:23,911
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

730
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:26,784
My daughter.

731
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,485
And if your daughter
was kidnapped,

732
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:34,748
would you wait around for
someone else to save her?

733
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:37,316
Or would you do it yourself?

734
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:47,543
All right, Nate.
Have it your way.

735
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:59,381
Got a trace on his cell.

736
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:05,344
Hey, you good?

737
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:07,302
Yeah. Let’s move.

738
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:16,094
11898, I
show your dispatch and send 29C-47.

739
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:19,140
This is a total
fucking shit show, man.

740
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:22,100
Look, there’s nothing on the
scanner about your brother.

741
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:24,058
That means he probably
lost the tail.

742
00:47:24,232 --> 00:47:25,930
Then why the fuck ain’t he here?

743
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,454
I don’t know!

744
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:30,748
Okay? I don’t know. I’m sorry.
I don’t know everything.

745
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:35,200
Maybe he had to switch vehicles.

746
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,898
Maybe he stopped off
to get some ice cream.

747
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:40,509
The point is, your
fucking whining about it

748
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:42,860
isn’t gonna make him
show up any faster.

749
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:47,299
Watch how you’re talking to me.

750
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:48,667
You may be running
point on this,

751
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:50,171
but you’re not my fucking boss.

752
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:52,130
Hmm.

753
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:54,219
Andre...

754
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:56,917
I need you to switch
up the vibe right now.

755
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:01,966
Because you’re bumming me out.

756
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:04,403
Come on.

757
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:06,144
Ben is gonna be
back in 15 minutes

758
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:08,407
and everything is gonna be fine.

759
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:11,801
Just keep saying it.
"Everything is gonna be fine."

760
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,238
Yeah, fucking right.

761
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,379
No more silent treatment, huh?

762
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:31,169
Hey.

763
00:48:32,692 --> 00:48:34,215
I’m sorry I hit you, okay?

764
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,524
Do you, um...

765
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:41,483
Do you want to hit me?

766
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:43,355
Make it even?

767
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:45,574
Fuck you.

768
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:47,533
Wow.

769
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,406
I do not like that tone.

770
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,018
I don’t like it.

771
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,936
But I got just the thing
to fix that attitude.

772
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,952
Oh, come on!

773
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:17,041
You love cola gummies.
Stop it, Simon!

774
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:18,737
Stop.

775
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:20,000
What is this?

776
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:22,568
Who is this little tantrum for?

777
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:27,573
We’re alone now.

778
00:49:27,747 --> 00:49:30,445
You can feel free to break
character whenever you’d like, sis.

779
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:32,336
It’s just that you promised
nobody would get hurt, okay?

780
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,492
You fucking promised.

781
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:34,928
It’s the heat of battle, Sher.

782
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:36,582
Shit happens. The
heat of battle?

783
00:49:36,756 --> 00:49:37,907
You did not have to kill Nigel!

784
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:40,629
Nigel? Who is Nigel?

785
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:42,196
The bank manager.

786
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,459
He was
a nice fucking guy.

787
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:46,200
He was a Nigel too, wasn’t he?

788
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:48,115
Nigel.

789
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:52,815
Sher.

790
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,035
I hate to break this to you,

791
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:57,951
but if you were able to get that
vault code out of lover boy,

792
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,103
everyone would be alive
right now, including Nigel.

793
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:01,999
Oh, my God. Hmm.

794
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,654
It’s not like he had
it framed on his wall.

795
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:09,571
Sounds a whole lot
like an excuse.

796
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:13,619
You know how I
feel about excuses.

797
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,360
Don’t you?

798
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:19,755
You’re so fucking impossible.

799
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,845
What’s done is done. Okay?

800
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,935
Let’s just stay
focused on the plan,

801
00:50:26,936 --> 00:50:28,256
and we can hash
all this out later

802
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:30,201
over some piña
coladas in Mexico.

803
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:32,899
Those are disgusting,
by the way.

804
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:36,685
Ugh! Gets
in your teeth.

805
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:57,924
Yeah? Hello, ma’am.

806
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:01,188
Um, is Zeno here?

807
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:02,962
I just need to talk
with him for a second.

808
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:04,626
Sorry, customers only.

809
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,889
You know what? That’s
actually why I’m here.

810
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,719
Um, I’m just looking
to get some work done.

811
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,050
Looks like you’ve already
had some work done today.

812
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,118
Sorry?

813
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,686
Oh! My appearance.

814
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:21,904
Uh, well,

815
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,777
you should see the other guy.

816
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:37,790
Thank you.

817
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:41,837
Oh.

818
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:43,926
Thought that was a
real guy for a second.

819
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,804
Wait here. Thank you.

820
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:10,214
You. What’s good?

821
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:13,217
I’m good. I’m...

822
00:52:13,391 --> 00:52:14,957
Everything’s good. Um...

823
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,743
Uh, I was just looking
to get a tattoo.

824
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:20,963
Fuck. What’s happening
with your hand?

825
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,139
Oh!

826
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:25,490
Psoriasis.

827
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:27,405
It’s really, really
flared up on me today.

828
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,102
Yeah, all right.

829
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:30,799
So where we working?

830
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:32,975
Uh, yeah, just, um...

831
00:52:34,499 --> 00:52:36,065
right here.

832
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,590
Damn. I like your
tats. That’s good shit.

833
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:40,418
Oh. Wow, thank you so much.

834
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:43,160
I, uh, I like yours, too.

835
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:46,032
So, uh, what you want?

836
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:48,904
Well, I have a
buddy of mine, um,

837
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:51,429
and he got this awesome tattoo.
I want the exact same one.

838
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:54,475
I think he said
that he got it here?

839
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:56,042
No shit.

840
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:58,262
You know Ben? Ben!

841
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:00,829
Yeah.Ben.

842
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:04,572
So, um, did you
guys serve together?

843
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:06,052
Yeah, we did.

844
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:07,880
Serve together.

845
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:10,012
Honorably. Hmm.

846
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:12,101
Rock on, brother.

847
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,063
Hey, um, speaking of Ben,

848
00:53:17,237 --> 00:53:19,457
is he still working
at the same place?

849
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:21,937
I don’t know. Ben
doesn’t talk about work.

850
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:23,896
Classic Ben. Hates work.

851
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:25,463
Hates it.

852
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,291
Um...

853
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:29,510
Funny story about Ben.

854
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:31,295
Um, you know his
last name, right?

855
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:32,513
Yeah.

856
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:34,341
Okay.

857
00:53:34,515 --> 00:53:36,125
How would you think
it’s pronounced?

858
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:46,353
Seriously, you’re gonna...
you’re gonna love this.

859
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:48,573
Just... just say his last name.

860
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:54,796
Why don’t you say it?

861
00:54:00,106 --> 00:54:01,325
Ah, you know, never mind.

862
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,372
It’s fine. It’s
not that funny.

863
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:07,132
Because, you know, if
you tell a bad joke,

864
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:08,810
you have to explain
it, it’s not good.

865
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:10,247
Yeah, give me a sec.

866
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:12,292
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Take your time.

867
00:54:18,994 --> 00:54:20,474
You know,

868
00:54:20,648 --> 00:54:22,694
I’m thinking that maybe
you don’t know Ben.

869
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,828
Yo, what the fuck is this?

870
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:29,122
I’m not gonna hurt you, okay?
Just put down the knife.

871
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:35,184
Tell me everything you know
about Ben and I’m gone.

872
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,447
Whoa!

873
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:39,841
Shit! Oh, no!

874
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:53,290
I’ll give you
another one for free.

875
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,511
Let me show
you how it’s done.

876
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:10,916
Shit. Fuck. Oh...

877
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:16,225
Fuck! Ow! Shit.

878
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:18,358
You little shit!

879
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:20,012
Fuck you, man.

880
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:30,762
Enough of this shit.

881
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:05,362
What the fuck are you doing?

882
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:23,292
Oh!

883
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,164
Fuck!

884
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:38,786
Shit! Fuck! My eyes!

885
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,005
Oh, fuck!

886
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:42,137
Oh, fuck!

887
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:45,314
I can’t see! Okay.
All right, man.

888
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,665
What the
fuck? What’s his name?

889
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,015
Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on, man.

890
00:56:53,279 --> 00:56:54,585
Okay. Look, look.

891
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:57,326
Please. Please don’t
make me do this.

892
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:59,546
Fucking eat shit, man.

893
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:03,332
Okay. Okay, this is
gonna suck. Are you sure?

894
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:04,856
Oh, fuck off!

895
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,379
Okay. Here we go.

896
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:08,555
Fuck!

897
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,296
Hey, hey, just give me his name.

898
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,429
Just give me his
name.

899
00:57:12,603 --> 00:57:14,169
Oh, Jesus!

900
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:16,389
Fuck, it’s Clark! It’s
Clark! Okay. Okay.

901
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:18,652
Clark, Ben. Ben Clark.

902
00:57:19,827 --> 00:57:21,394
There we go. Was that so hard?

903
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:24,702
Listen, I’ve given
you what you want.

904
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:26,355
Now
just fucking go.

905
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,748
Just one second. One second.

906
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:30,708
Oh, shit.

907
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:33,145
Hey there, Chad, it’s Nate
over at San Diego Trust.

908
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,713
Glad I caught you
before the holiday.

909
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:38,542
Yeah, listen, I was hoping you
could run a quick credit check

910
00:57:38,716 --> 00:57:40,413
on a new client whose
file’s incomplete.

911
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:42,197
His name is Ben
Clark.

912
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,852
He did serve in the military.
Does that narrow it down?

913
00:57:46,593 --> 00:57:49,030
Yeah. Yeah, V.A.
loans. That’s him.

914
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:52,425
Um, you don’t have any
employment on record, do you?

915
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:55,036
How about a
last-known residence?

916
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,693
Yeah, um, yeah, hold
on one second. Um...

917
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:05,177
Okay, shoot.

918
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,658
Okay.

919
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,052
402...

920
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:16,057
North Tower Lane.

921
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:19,408
All right. Chad, thank
you so much, man.

922
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:20,627
You’re the best.

923
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,629
Oh.

924
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:25,589
Yeah, Merry Christmas
to you, too. Go, Padres.

925
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:10,459
Something’s wrong.
He should definitely be here.

926
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,090
Look, he’s got plenty of time. We
can’t leave till it’s dark anyway.

927
00:59:13,114 --> 00:59:15,005
I’m gonna check his house.
The house he just spent

928
00:59:15,029 --> 00:59:17,379
all weekend booby-trapping like
he’s Wile E. fucking Coyote?

929
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,730
That house? You think
he’s gonna go back there?

930
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:20,904
Use your brain, man.

931
00:59:20,992 --> 00:59:22,123
He’s my brother!

932
00:59:22,297 --> 00:59:23,560
I’m well aware of that.

933
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:25,134
Take a half hour.
If he’s not there,

934
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,563
I’ll come back and we can go.

935
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:28,913
Andre.

936
00:59:30,044 --> 00:59:31,263
Andre!

937
00:59:31,437 --> 00:59:33,308
Don’t be a fucking idiot!

938
01:00:29,364 --> 01:00:30,496
All right.

939
01:00:37,459 --> 01:00:40,637
Okay, so you’re a prepper.

940
01:00:41,376 --> 01:00:42,508
Ew.

941
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:47,731
Where the hell do you work?

942
01:00:54,868 --> 01:00:55,869
What?

943
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,002
What is that?

944
01:01:02,876 --> 01:01:04,008
What the fuck is that?

945
01:01:05,313 --> 01:01:06,619
Why?

946
01:01:09,143 --> 01:01:10,754
Okay, uh...

947
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:16,934
All right.

948
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:25,377
Whoa. Hmm.

949
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:33,864
No.

950
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:49,531
There you are.

951
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:53,013
Oh.

952
01:01:53,927 --> 01:01:55,537
Come on! Really?

953
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,982
Crossbow under the sink.

954
01:02:06,157 --> 01:02:07,245
Of course.

955
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:19,083
All right, whatever... Fuck it.

956
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:01,952
Okay. Okay.

957
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:12,092
Yes. Yes!

958
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:15,661
Yes.

959
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:20,405
Okay. I found you.

960
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,755
And now I’m gonna make
you wish you never...

961
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:24,409
Oh, my God!

962
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:27,499
What?

963
01:03:33,244 --> 01:03:34,723
What the fuck?

964
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:38,815
Oh, fu...

965
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:48,172
Oh, phew. Big phew.

966
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:50,609
Okay. Um...

967
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,840
This better be you
calling from a hospital or a jail.

968
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:00,227
No, not quite. I’m at, uh,

969
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:02,621
402 North Tower
Lane in Cortez Hill.

970
01:04:02,795 --> 01:04:04,904
I’m hanging upside-down and
I need you to come get me.

971
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:07,008
What the hell do you mean
you’re hanging upside-down?

972
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,671
I mean I’m currently suspended
in some kind of snare trap,

973
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,726
and if you don’t come
right now and cut me down,

974
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,806
then Sherry’s gonna die.
I’m probably gonna die.

975
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,380
Dude, you can’t put
that shit on me.

976
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,698
I’m not getting
involved in this.

977
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:18,506
You already are, okay?

978
01:04:19,638 --> 01:04:21,640
Look, man, I’m sorry. I just...

979
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:26,906
I don’t know who else to call.

980
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,605
Maybe to you I’m just some random
guy you met on the Internet,

981
01:04:30,779 --> 01:04:33,454
but to me, all that time we spent
together it actually meant something.

982
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:34,740
You’re...

983
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:39,092
You’re my only friend, Roscoe.

984
01:04:39,266 --> 01:04:40,441
And right now,

985
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,053
I need you.

986
01:04:43,227 --> 01:04:45,185
Oh, goddamn it!

987
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,970
Okay, look, it says
fifteen minutes,

988
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:49,078
but I’ll take the Harley and
be there in ten, all right?

989
01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:51,496
Yes! Yes, thank you.
Thank you so much.

990
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:53,230
Yeah, yeah,
just hang in there.

991
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:55,543
Sorry, that wasn’t a pun.
I meant it sincerely.

992
01:04:55,717 --> 01:04:57,415
No, no, it was
funny. It was funny.

993
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:58,851
Just please hurry, okay?

994
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:00,026
Yeah, okay. Bye.

995
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:02,246
Okay. Okay.

996
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:03,987
Okay, ten minutes.

997
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:05,553
Ten minutes.

998
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:07,707
I can make it ten
minutes. Okay.

999
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:10,601
Ben?

1000
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:12,560
Oh, no.

1001
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:15,912
You here, bro?

1002
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,943
Hi.

1003
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,337
Who the hell are you?

1004
01:05:50,511 --> 01:05:52,426
Uh. I’m... I’m just a thief.

1005
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,733
You know, just
came here to, uh...

1006
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,215
thieve.

1007
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:00,477
Where’s my brother?

1008
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:02,654
I’m sorry, your what?

1009
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:04,873
Uh, look, man, look,
I don’t know anything

1010
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,658
about anybody’s brother. I’m...

1011
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:10,096
You know, I just randomly
picked this place and, uh,

1012
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,751
well, apparently,
I picked wrong.

1013
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:14,445
You know, most people
have the doorbell

1014
01:06:14,492 --> 01:06:16,668
with the camera, but
an indoor snare trap?

1015
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:18,844
Egg on my face.

1016
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,412
You don’t look like a thief.

1017
01:06:21,586 --> 01:06:22,717
Yeah, well,

1018
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:25,938
the best of us rarely do. Hmm.

1019
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:30,987
So you just picked this
place at random, huh?

1020
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:33,293
Yeah. Yeah, just
my luck. Yeah?

1021
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:34,947
Then why the fuck

1022
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:39,169
do you have his address
on your fucking hand?

1023
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:44,130
That’s such a good question.

1024
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:46,306
And...

1025
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,200
...the answer’s really
gonna blow your mind.

1026
01:06:49,614 --> 01:06:52,138
Yeah, you can go ahead and
take that if you need to.

1027
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,401
Yeah?

1028
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,013
Look, um...

1029
01:06:59,363 --> 01:07:00,363
Ben’s dead.

1030
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:03,367
Just heard it over the scanner.

1031
01:07:06,457 --> 01:07:09,155
Who did it? Cops? Uh, no.

1032
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:11,592
Apparently, it was just
some random Good Samaritan.

1033
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:14,160
Skinny guy in a suit.

1034
01:07:15,988 --> 01:07:17,120
Look, um,

1035
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:19,401
why don’t you just get back here

1036
01:07:19,557 --> 01:07:20,688
and we’ll figure it all out?

1037
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:25,128
Did he seriously
just hang up on me?

1038
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:38,967
Whoa, whoa, hey, hold on.

1039
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:40,684
Hold on. Hey. Let’s
just talk about this.

1040
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:41,883
You killed my brother!

1041
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,494
Look, man, I, uh...

1042
01:07:46,671 --> 01:07:48,803
I did kill him.

1043
01:07:48,977 --> 01:07:51,086
And, look, I know that means
you’re gonna kill me, too,

1044
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,547
but please just do me
a favor, okay? Just...

1045
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:55,593
Just make it quick.

1046
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:58,422
There’s no need
to draw this out.

1047
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:04,689
I got a better idea.

1048
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,432
Yes!

1049
01:08:08,606 --> 01:08:11,435
You know, when
I used to do this shit

1050
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,741
back in special forces...

1051
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:15,352
Mmm.

1052
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:18,006
...it was always to try
and get some information.

1053
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,356
Mm-hmm.

1054
01:08:20,618 --> 01:08:22,446
But all that matters now...

1055
01:08:23,055 --> 01:08:24,143
is the pain.

1056
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:27,363
Think about that.
You understand pain?

1057
01:08:27,537 --> 01:08:29,366
Yeah... I hate it so much.

1058
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,546
Oh. Oh! No! Stop it!

1059
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,332
I mean, oh, fuck!

1060
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:41,856
This is bad!

1061
01:08:42,029 --> 01:08:43,640
Goddamn it!

1062
01:08:48,907 --> 01:08:49,951
Oh, wow.

1063
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:54,694
Oh, God, you sadistic fuck.

1064
01:08:55,305 --> 01:08:57,916
Oh.

1065
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:01,876
No, not the pliers.

1066
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,791
Please, not the pliers.

1067
01:09:03,965 --> 01:09:06,142
I can’t even imagine what
you’re gonna do with that.

1068
01:09:06,316 --> 01:09:08,578
Please. Oh!

1069
01:09:08,752 --> 01:09:10,145
This little piggy...

1070
01:09:10,755 --> 01:09:12,322
went to market.

1071
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:18,545
God, I hate how you spend
so much time on this.

1072
01:09:20,024 --> 01:09:22,332
This little piggy...
Oh, boy.

1073
01:09:22,506 --> 01:09:25,029
This little piggy... Uh-huh?

1074
01:09:26,423 --> 01:09:28,642
...went wee, wee,
wee, wee, wee...

1075
01:09:28,816 --> 01:09:30,470
fucking all the way
home!

1076
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:33,343
Oh, wow, that hurt!
That one hurt the most.

1077
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:36,127
How you doing?

1078
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:37,911
Terribly.

1079
01:09:37,999 --> 01:09:40,611
No! Please, no.

1080
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:43,048
Whoa, all this sucks so bad.

1081
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,571
Please don’t do that again.

1082
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:50,621
What?

1083
01:09:50,795 --> 01:09:52,642
Where the
hell are you? We’re leaving

1084
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:54,121
in thirty minutes. Get
your ass back here.

1085
01:09:54,145 --> 01:09:56,496
Yeah, yeah. I will wrap it up.

1086
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,938
Now for my favorite part.

1087
01:10:08,856 --> 01:10:13,165
I’m gonna keep your eyes
in a jar on my mantel.

1088
01:10:14,688 --> 01:10:16,995
Oh, wait, don’t do
that. No. Uh, uh...

1089
01:10:17,169 --> 01:10:18,388
Actually, don’t do that.

1090
01:10:18,562 --> 01:10:19,911
Uh, hey, hey! Your brother...

1091
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:21,739
Your brother told
me something...

1092
01:10:21,913 --> 01:10:24,698
before he died. He said, uh...

1093
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:27,048
He said, um...

1094
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,356
"Tell my brother I’m sorry."

1095
01:10:32,576 --> 01:10:33,620
"I’m sorry...

1096
01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:38,930
for that thing that
happened when we were kids."

1097
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:42,760
And...

1098
01:10:43,978 --> 01:10:46,372
...he said, "Tell him...

1099
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:50,071
Tell him that Mom and Dad
always loved you the most."

1100
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:54,772
Bullshit.

1101
01:10:56,687 --> 01:10:58,254
We never met our dad.

1102
01:10:58,428 --> 01:11:00,647
Okay, I think maybe he
meant it metaphorically.

1103
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:03,084
Wait, no! Please, please,
please, please don’t!

1104
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:07,393
Roscoe?

1105
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:09,221
No, it’s fucking Daft Punk.

1106
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:12,877
Of course it’s me.

1107
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,098
Thank God. I was...

1108
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:21,059
Huh. What do you mean, "huh"?

1109
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:23,975
Uh... No, I mean,
um... it’s just, uh...

1110
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:25,716
Didn’t you say...

1111
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:27,892
that you were six-foot-five

1112
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:29,981
and that you looked
like Jason Momoa?

1113
01:11:30,155 --> 01:11:32,070
I said I kind of look
like Jason Momoa.

1114
01:11:32,244 --> 01:11:33,463
Right.

1115
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:36,944
He’s just a very
specific-looking man.

1116
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:39,512
How about you just say, "Thank
you for saving my life"?

1117
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:42,036
You’re totally right.
Absolutely. Sorry.

1118
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:47,259
Oh, hey. Thank you.

1119
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:49,261
Okay.

1120
01:11:50,262 --> 01:11:51,394
Okay, that’s enough.

1121
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:54,672
Look, go do whatever
you got to do

1122
01:11:54,788 --> 01:11:56,268
and please stay alive.

1123
01:11:56,442 --> 01:11:57,965
I need you to be physically able

1124
01:11:58,139 --> 01:11:59,419
to explain all this to the cops.

1125
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:01,969
Okay... I will stay
alive, I promise.

1126
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,626
You’re gonna have to
do better than that.

1127
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,975
Oh!

1128
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:09,629
Whoa!

1129
01:12:09,716 --> 01:12:11,762
Roscoe, get something!
Right! Oh, shit. Oh.

1130
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,252
You
motherfuckers. Heads up!

1131
01:12:35,438 --> 01:12:36,613
Oh, shit! Sorry.

1132
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:38,571
It’s fine. Just
get something else.

1133
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:42,140
Fucker!

1134
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:47,667
You bunch of...

1135
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:50,061
Aw, shit, man!

1136
01:12:50,235 --> 01:12:51,845
Bear mace. Yeah, more, more!

1137
01:12:54,892 --> 01:12:56,154
Yeah, more.

1138
01:12:56,328 --> 01:12:57,982
Yeah, do you like
this?

1139
01:12:58,156 --> 01:12:59,331
Yeah, that’s right, bi...

1140
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:01,202
Oh, goddamn it!

1141
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,769
I’m gonna kill you!

1142
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:04,292
Whoa!

1143
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:21,092
I’m gonna fucking rip
your fucking head off!

1144
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:24,225
Just... die!

1145
01:13:45,595 --> 01:13:46,987
Ah, okay.

1146
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:55,561
Good thinking with the mace.

1147
01:13:55,735 --> 01:13:57,215
Yeah.

1148
01:14:01,001 --> 01:14:02,002
Jesus!

1149
01:14:02,176 --> 01:14:05,005
Hell of a way to go.Uh-huh.

1150
01:14:09,923 --> 01:14:12,143
What’d
you set a timer for?

1151
01:14:12,317 --> 01:14:14,537
Um, it was for your...

1152
01:14:15,363 --> 01:14:17,496
for your ETA or whatever.

1153
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,805
I actually should pee, though.

1154
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:23,110
Yeah.

1155
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,982
Wait, what?

1156
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:31,162
Who the fuck are
these guys, anyway?

1157
01:14:31,771 --> 01:14:32,946
No idea.

1158
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,687
Huge Home Alonefans, apparently.

1159
01:14:40,824 --> 01:14:42,260
Hey, um...

1160
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:46,133
thanks again for coming.

1161
01:14:46,307 --> 01:14:50,137
Yeah, well...
...what are friends for, right?

1162
01:14:52,357 --> 01:14:54,707
Yeah, man. That being said...

1163
01:14:54,881 --> 01:14:56,796
I will testify against
you if need be.

1164
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:59,233
Yeah, no, no
worries. I assumed.

1165
01:15:02,323 --> 01:15:03,542
Oh, shit. It’s the cops.

1166
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:05,109
Well, great.

1167
01:15:05,283 --> 01:15:06,963
Tell them everything.
Let them go save her.

1168
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:08,610
No, no, no. They’re
not gonna listen to me.

1169
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:10,375
They think I’m in on
this.

1170
01:15:10,549 --> 01:15:12,725
No, if I go out there, they’ll
bring me to the station.

1171
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,921
And by the time I can convince
anybody to go after Sherry,

1172
01:15:14,945 --> 01:15:15,945
she’ll be dead.

1173
01:15:18,165 --> 01:15:19,166
Wait a minute.

1174
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:21,560
I think I have an idea.

1175
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:23,016
Your Harley... it’s still
parked out front, yeah?

1176
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,084
Yeah.

1177
01:15:24,868 --> 01:15:25,869
Sort of.

1178
01:15:26,913 --> 01:15:28,175
What do you mean "sort of"?

1179
01:15:32,963 --> 01:15:34,442
Nathan Caine!

1180
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:37,402
I need you to come out the
house with your hands up.

1181
01:15:39,404 --> 01:15:41,667
Look, don’t make this harder
than it has to be, okay?

1182
01:15:41,841 --> 01:15:43,930
This whole town’s going to shit

1183
01:15:44,104 --> 01:15:46,585
’cause the Chargers and
the Clippers betrayed us.

1184
01:15:46,759 --> 01:15:48,761
Really? Now?

1185
01:15:48,935 --> 01:15:50,676
Seriously. Broke
our heart for what?

1186
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,722
To be second fiddle to
the Rams and the Lakers?

1187
01:15:52,896 --> 01:15:54,593
Freeze! Freeze!

1188
01:15:54,767 --> 01:15:56,247
Hey!

1189
01:15:56,421 --> 01:15:59,163
Freeze! Freeze! Hey,
stop! Stop! Shit.

1190
01:16:12,176 --> 01:16:13,481
Wait, what is he doing?

1191
01:16:13,656 --> 01:16:15,353
I don’t know.

1192
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:19,009
Hands!

1193
01:16:19,183 --> 01:16:21,054
Let me see your hands! Hands!

1194
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:28,192
Shit.

1195
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:29,585
Who the hell is this guy?

1196
01:16:29,759 --> 01:16:31,021
Ha, ha, ha!

1197
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:32,979
You’ve been deceived,
for I am not Nate!

1198
01:16:33,153 --> 01:16:34,633
Don’t care.

1199
01:16:36,243 --> 01:16:39,725
But
who you are is somebody...

1200
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:42,380
who’s about to go to
jail. No, no, wait, wait!

1201
01:16:42,554 --> 01:16:44,835
I can help you! I can help
you! I know where Nate’s going.

1202
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:46,471
Yeah? Start talking
then. Okay, okay,

1203
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:48,710
but could we have a no-kicking
policy from this point on?

1204
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,518
Where is he?

1205
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:05,359
All right,
come on! Time to go!

1206
01:17:10,582 --> 01:17:12,802
Where is your jumpsuit?
I’m not doing this, Simon.

1207
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:15,718
Not doing what?

1208
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,024
It’s already done.

1209
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:21,245
Can’t do it.

1210
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:22,942
Oh, fuck off.

1211
01:17:25,118 --> 01:17:28,426
Since when did you grow a
conscience anyway?

1212
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,168
I mean, what about all
the other jobs we’ve done?

1213
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:32,865
We’ve killed
people before. No.

1214
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:35,738
No. You’ve killed people
before, Simon. You.

1215
01:17:35,912 --> 01:17:37,391
Not me. I’m not like you.

1216
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:41,961
The thing is...

1217
01:17:42,135 --> 01:17:44,355
you’re not a better
person than I am.

1218
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:46,574
Not even a little bit.

1219
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:48,359
’Cause you won’t
admit what you are.

1220
01:17:49,882 --> 01:17:54,191
You think all this fake remorse
is gonna save your soul? Hm?

1221
01:17:56,149 --> 01:17:57,324
It’s bullshit...

1222
01:17:57,498 --> 01:17:58,935
Simon.

1223
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:01,546
...and you know it.

1224
01:18:04,331 --> 01:18:05,550
Drop the gun!

1225
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:07,639
Oh, my God. Nate.

1226
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:09,293
I’m not gonna ask you again.

1227
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,817
Okay.

1228
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,696
You okay, Sherry?

1229
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:24,350
Um...

1230
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:25,918
I’m sorry,

1231
01:18:26,092 --> 01:18:27,441
who the fuck are you?

1232
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,357
I’m the guy that
killed your friends.

1233
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:33,597
So if you don’t want
to wind up like them,

1234
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:35,449
I suggest you let her go,

1235
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:37,060
and you get the
hell out of here.

1236
01:18:39,149 --> 01:18:41,673
Oh, my God.

1237
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:45,938
Oh, my fucking God.

1238
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:49,072
Simon, don’t.

1239
01:18:52,162 --> 01:18:55,165
You’re the guy from
the bank, right?

1240
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:01,040
Okay.

1241
01:19:01,214 --> 01:19:03,814
This is legitimately the funniest
thing that’s ever happened to me.

1242
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:08,352
You’ve been tailing us
to try to save... Sherry.

1243
01:19:09,353 --> 01:19:11,224
Is that right?

1244
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:13,270
Uh...

1245
01:19:13,444 --> 01:19:15,707
I hate to break it
to you, bud, but...

1246
01:19:18,188 --> 01:19:19,885
she’s my fucking sister.

1247
01:19:25,021 --> 01:19:27,588
She played you, man. Yeah.

1248
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,771
You thought that
she had feelings for you.

1249
01:19:35,945 --> 01:19:37,947
Stop, don’t. Nate, I’m...

1250
01:19:39,339 --> 01:19:40,558
I’m so sorry, okay?

1251
01:19:40,732 --> 01:19:43,343
I never meant for
you to... to...

1252
01:19:43,517 --> 01:19:45,157
Look, everything that
happened between us,

1253
01:19:45,215 --> 01:19:46,869
I meant it, okay? It
was real, I swear.

1254
01:19:47,043 --> 01:19:48,883
Oh, what a load of
horseshit!

1255
01:19:49,001 --> 01:19:50,655
Look, man,

1256
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:53,005
you’re pointing the gun at
the wrong bank robber, dude.

1257
01:19:53,963 --> 01:19:55,965
You should be shooting her.

1258
01:19:57,488 --> 01:19:58,881
So, now listen.

1259
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:03,711
Why don’t you just get
out of here, man. Okay?

1260
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:06,540
What are you doing?

1261
01:20:06,714 --> 01:20:08,804
Get yourself to the urgent care,

1262
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:11,110
and just forget all about this.

1263
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:12,284
Simon, stop it.

1264
01:20:12,416 --> 01:20:13,678
Get over it.

1265
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:50,062
I’ll give it to you, bank boy.

1266
01:20:50,715 --> 01:20:52,108
You can take a punch.

1267
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,723
Let’s see how you do...

1268
01:20:58,897 --> 01:21:00,943
...under a little pressure.

1269
01:21:01,117 --> 01:21:02,509
Perfect.

1270
01:21:09,255 --> 01:21:10,822
Simon, stop it!

1271
01:21:12,911 --> 01:21:14,511
It’s not
fucking funny. Stop it!

1272
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:18,830
Stop!

1273
01:21:21,528 --> 01:21:22,573
Stop!

1274
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:26,205
What the hell you doing?
What are you doing?

1275
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:27,336
Are you just gonna
crush his head?

1276
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,884
Well, he started it!

1277
01:21:31,451 --> 01:21:32,670
Just go.

1278
01:21:32,844 --> 01:21:34,444
Honestly, just go!
Take the money and go!

1279
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:35,847
I’m gonna stay with him.

1280
01:21:36,021 --> 01:21:38,023
You’re gonna
stay with that guy?

1281
01:21:38,197 --> 01:21:39,416
Yeah.

1282
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:40,852
Sherry.

1283
01:21:42,506 --> 01:21:43,550
Come on!

1284
01:21:46,075 --> 01:21:48,033
I don’t even know you anymore.

1285
01:21:52,168 --> 01:21:53,169
Fine.

1286
01:21:53,778 --> 01:21:54,778
Hmm.

1287
01:22:03,353 --> 01:22:05,442
You won’t do it. Yeah?

1288
01:22:05,616 --> 01:22:06,660
You sure?

1289
01:22:07,444 --> 01:22:08,445
Mm-hmm.

1290
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,192
You know what? You’re right.

1291
01:22:17,193 --> 01:22:18,890
You don’t know me anymore.

1292
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:30,902
Got him! Moving in.

1293
01:22:33,426 --> 01:22:35,037
Hands! Hands up!

1294
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:36,995
Get them on your head.

1295
01:22:42,827 --> 01:22:44,611
This one’s
cooked. Help this guy.

1296
01:22:49,181 --> 01:22:51,618
Damn, Vespa guy was right.
He’s pretty beat up.

1297
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:54,970
Yeah, well, good thing
we’re here to save his ass.

1298
01:22:57,102 --> 01:22:59,191
You’re lucky that you
got such a good friend.

1299
01:22:59,365 --> 01:23:00,976
Little too chatty
for me, though.

1300
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:24,434
Backup will be here in five.
They’re still stretched thin.

1301
01:23:24,608 --> 01:23:26,436
Does that mean I
can punch out now?

1302
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:28,650
Wanda’s gonna start It’s a
Wonderful Life without me.

1303
01:23:28,786 --> 01:23:30,786
Yeah, we’ll just get the
elves to do your paperwork.

1304
01:23:30,918 --> 01:23:32,548
Mm-hmm. Wouldn’t that
be amazing if we had...

1305
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:23,623
Hey, hey.

1306
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:25,930
Show me where you’re
hurt.

1307
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:30,282
You’re gonna be okay.

1308
01:24:30,456 --> 01:24:31,936
You just have to
get to a hospital.

1309
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:33,764
I’m gonna take your
car and go after them.

1310
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:35,809
Like hell! I’m not
giving you my keys.

1311
01:24:37,724 --> 01:24:39,378
Sorry.

1312
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,684
Don’t worry...

1313
01:24:40,858 --> 01:24:41,989
...I’m gonna make sure...

1314
01:24:46,777 --> 01:24:48,126
You’re really gonna shoot me?

1315
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,780
I should, asshole.

1316
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:53,392
But I won’t. You’re
taking me with you.

1317
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:58,222
Okay.

1318
01:25:07,624 --> 01:25:10,844
Uh, hey, hi. Uh, could someone
please tell me what’s going on?

1319
01:25:11,018 --> 01:25:13,456
Go, go, go! We’re gonna
lose him! Yeah, don’t worry.

1320
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:15,371
I know where he’s going.

1321
01:25:15,545 --> 01:25:16,850
Where who’s going?

1322
01:25:17,024 --> 01:25:18,176
Oh, we’re on a high-speed
chase right now?

1323
01:25:27,557 --> 01:25:28,557
Fuck!

1324
01:25:41,527 --> 01:25:43,094
Oh, shit.

1325
01:25:49,753 --> 01:25:51,774
At this speed, you won’t be
able to make any adjustments,

1326
01:25:51,798 --> 01:25:53,036
and I don’t know
how you drive...

1327
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,714
School
bus!

1328
01:26:14,473 --> 01:26:15,605
What the fuck?

1329
01:26:16,649 --> 01:26:18,085
You again?

1330
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:21,001
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1331
01:26:42,153 --> 01:26:43,720
Stroller! Yo!

1332
01:26:43,894 --> 01:26:46,592
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1333
01:26:48,028 --> 01:26:49,943
Jesus! Where’d you learn
to drive like this?

1334
01:26:50,117 --> 01:26:51,641
I used to boost cars.

1335
01:26:54,165 --> 01:26:55,688
What? I don’t anymore!

1336
01:27:01,868 --> 01:27:03,696
Oh, I might be dying,

1337
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,394
but I’m gonna kill you first.

1338
01:27:20,104 --> 01:27:21,671
Oh, shit.

1339
01:27:24,064 --> 01:27:26,153
Fuck!

1340
01:27:32,464 --> 01:27:35,032
Oh. You fucking loser.

1341
01:27:39,428 --> 01:27:41,168
So where’s this son
of a bitch going?

1342
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:42,692
He’s headed to Pier 7.

1343
01:27:43,736 --> 01:27:45,651
What for? There’s
a boat waiting.

1344
01:27:45,825 --> 01:27:46,957
It was gonna take us south.

1345
01:27:47,131 --> 01:27:49,176
Taxi! I
can see, thank you!

1346
01:28:01,014 --> 01:28:03,060
Hey, slow down! Stop! Stop!

1347
01:28:10,328 --> 01:28:11,697
You want to
know something funny?

1348
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:13,940
If you’d have just
stayed in that bank,

1349
01:28:15,115 --> 01:28:17,248
Sherry would be right
here sitting next to me.

1350
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:22,688
She’d be just fine.

1351
01:28:23,472 --> 01:28:24,821
But now?

1352
01:28:25,561 --> 01:28:26,779
Now...

1353
01:28:26,953 --> 01:28:28,564
I’m gonna hunt her ass down.

1354
01:28:29,434 --> 01:28:31,001
I promise you that.

1355
01:28:32,394 --> 01:28:33,395
Yeah, well...

1356
01:28:35,484 --> 01:28:37,181
if you do find Sherry...

1357
01:28:39,488 --> 01:28:41,117
I want you to tell her
something for me, okay?

1358
01:28:41,141 --> 01:28:42,578
Oh, God.

1359
01:28:44,884 --> 01:28:47,017
You are one sorry
son of a bitch.

1360
01:28:47,191 --> 01:28:49,367
You know that?

1361
01:28:51,543 --> 01:28:53,545
Yeah. I know, right?

1362
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:55,808
It’s kind of my thing.

1363
01:28:56,853 --> 01:28:58,942
Listen, I want
you to tell her...

1364
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:03,786
...that even though we didn’t
spend a lot of time together,

1365
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:07,559
that I always felt like we...

1366
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,519
could’ve gone...

1367
01:29:11,563 --> 01:29:12,564
What?

1368
01:29:14,697 --> 01:29:16,612
What’d you feel
like?

1369
01:29:16,786 --> 01:29:18,657
What was that?

1370
01:29:18,831 --> 01:29:21,573
I can’t fucking hear you.
You’re mumbling. Speak up!

1371
01:29:21,747 --> 01:29:23,880
Oh, sorry. I’ll try
to be a little more...

1372
01:29:24,054 --> 01:29:25,054
clear!

1373
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,727
I like that you’re making
me earn it, bank boy,

1374
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:13,468
but we got to wrap this up.

1375
01:31:16,427 --> 01:31:17,646
Let’s go.

1376
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,778
What?

1377
01:31:19,952 --> 01:31:20,953
Fuck, I can’t.

1378
01:31:21,127 --> 01:31:22,477
I can’t.

1379
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,524
I’m sorry, I have
to go. Wait, wait.

1380
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:32,225
God, I hope I live
to regret this.

1381
01:31:33,879 --> 01:31:34,880
Take it.

1382
01:31:35,968 --> 01:31:38,580
That motherfucker
shot my partner.

1383
01:31:41,365 --> 01:31:42,497
Don’t miss.

1384
01:31:48,546 --> 01:31:50,417
And you, out! Oh, okay.

1385
01:31:51,897 --> 01:31:52,897
Get her to a hospital.

1386
01:31:52,985 --> 01:31:54,465
Sure. Yeah. Go.

1387
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,600
Oh! God, that’s a
lot of blood. Huh.

1388
01:31:58,774 --> 01:32:00,906
At least it’s not a stick
shift, am I right?

1389
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,473
Sorry. Bleeding
to death. Right.

1390
01:32:22,711 --> 01:32:23,799
Oh.

1391
01:32:31,197 --> 01:32:33,678
End of the line, bank boy.

1392
01:33:03,839 --> 01:33:05,231
You always did fight dirty.

1393
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:15,459
Sherry!

1394
01:33:16,808 --> 01:33:18,088
Looks like I finally found a way

1395
01:33:18,244 --> 01:33:19,637
to make you feel something, huh?

1396
01:34:02,724 --> 01:34:05,248
It’s okay. I got you.

1397
01:34:08,294 --> 01:34:09,295
Hey, asshole.

1398
01:34:09,948 --> 01:34:11,080
Feel this.

1399
01:34:25,616 --> 01:34:27,966
Nate! Hey, Nate?

1400
01:34:28,793 --> 01:34:31,404
Nate, hey. Nate.

1401
01:34:32,188 --> 01:34:33,755
Hi. Hey...

1402
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,452
Sherry...

1403
01:34:37,802 --> 01:34:39,151
I love you.

1404
01:34:41,545 --> 01:34:43,416
You’re really cool.

1405
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:49,118
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

1406
01:34:49,292 --> 01:34:51,337
No. Hey! Hey!

1407
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:52,948
Nate, please.

1408
01:34:53,122 --> 01:34:55,080
Help! We’re over here! Please!

1409
01:34:57,039 --> 01:34:59,911
I’m so sorry,
Nate. I’m so sorry.

1410
01:35:00,085 --> 01:35:01,217
I’m here. I’m right here.

1411
01:35:01,391 --> 01:35:02,914
I’m not going
anywhere, I promise.

1412
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:04,698
I’m sorry.

1413
01:35:07,179 --> 01:35:08,354
I’m sorry.

1414
01:35:45,435 --> 01:35:47,480
Hey, hey, hey.

1415
01:35:47,654 --> 01:35:49,395
There he is.

1416
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:51,484
How you feeling, bud?

1417
01:35:51,658 --> 01:35:53,051
What happened?

1418
01:35:53,225 --> 01:35:56,533
Oof. Well, you’ve had
some major blood loss.

1419
01:35:56,707 --> 01:35:58,578
Oh. And a heart attack.

1420
01:35:58,753 --> 01:35:59,971
And a brain hemorrhage.

1421
01:36:01,016 --> 01:36:02,234
And third-degree burns.

1422
01:36:02,408 --> 01:36:04,410
And a lot of broken bones.

1423
01:36:04,584 --> 01:36:05,716
But you’re okay now!

1424
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:07,674
It’s a
Christmas miracle.

1425
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:10,199
It’s Christmas?

1426
01:36:10,373 --> 01:36:11,766
It’s actually January 11th.

1427
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,637
You’ve been in a
medically induced coma.

1428
01:36:13,811 --> 01:36:16,292
But still...
...you’re alive!

1429
01:36:19,512 --> 01:36:22,385
Wait. Sherry. Is
she... is she okay?

1430
01:36:22,559 --> 01:36:24,213
Don’t worry. Sherry’s fine.

1431
01:36:24,822 --> 01:36:25,823
She’s okay.

1432
01:36:26,911 --> 01:36:27,911
Yeesh.

1433
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:29,914
Oh. We meet again. Hey.

1434
01:36:30,088 --> 01:36:32,047
Hey! Look who’s up.

1435
01:36:32,221 --> 01:36:33,265
Yep.

1436
01:36:33,439 --> 01:36:35,485
You look... Um...

1437
01:36:36,921 --> 01:36:37,921
brave.

1438
01:36:38,009 --> 01:36:39,445
I’m glad you’re up

1439
01:36:39,619 --> 01:36:41,534
because I just came
from the courthouse.

1440
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:44,189
You’re looking at some
pretty serious charges here.

1441
01:36:44,363 --> 01:36:45,887
Manslaughter,
breaking and entering,

1442
01:36:46,061 --> 01:36:47,061
grand theft auto.

1443
01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:48,498
Yeah, those...

1444
01:36:49,586 --> 01:36:50,586
Those sound really bad.

1445
01:36:50,674 --> 01:36:51,849
Yeah, they are.

1446
01:36:52,023 --> 01:36:52,850
There’s enough
here to lock you up

1447
01:36:53,024 --> 01:36:54,064
until you’re twice my age.

1448
01:36:54,112 --> 01:36:55,200
Uh-huh.

1449
01:36:55,374 --> 01:36:57,072
But you did save a cop’s life.

1450
01:36:57,246 --> 01:37:00,640
And you also had some pretty
persuasive character witnesses.

1451
01:37:02,468 --> 01:37:04,949
Also, you’re a white guy
who works for a bank, so...

1452
01:37:05,123 --> 01:37:06,429
the judge took it easy on you.

1453
01:37:06,603 --> 01:37:08,561
Six months house arrest.

1454
01:37:08,735 --> 01:37:10,999
Five years probation.

1455
01:37:11,173 --> 01:37:13,454
Get a lawyer to look at that,
but it’s a pretty good deal.

1456
01:37:15,003 --> 01:37:16,004
Oh.

1457
01:37:16,178 --> 01:37:18,267
Almost forgot the best part.

1458
01:37:20,573 --> 01:37:22,488
This is from Grace.

1459
01:37:24,447 --> 01:37:25,448
My daughter.

1460
01:37:31,454 --> 01:37:32,672
Take care, Nate.

1461
01:37:34,457 --> 01:37:35,632
Thank you, Detective.

1462
01:37:35,806 --> 01:37:37,155
Detective.

1463
01:37:46,643 --> 01:37:48,645
You’re look... Are you
looking at the hand?

1464
01:37:48,819 --> 01:37:51,300
Oh, the hand? Oh, you mean
your burnt-up, crisped-up hand?

1465
01:37:51,474 --> 01:37:52,867
Yeah. Yeah.

1466
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:54,869
I mean, it’s... it’s
jarring, for sure.

1467
01:37:55,043 --> 01:37:56,218
Is it the worst part?

1468
01:37:56,392 --> 01:37:57,717
I just think they
shouldn’t have to

1469
01:37:57,741 --> 01:37:59,874
dress it up all sexy,
like in fishnets.

1470
01:38:00,048 --> 01:38:01,484
It’s a skin graft.

1471
01:38:01,658 --> 01:38:04,095
Look, I would get
a glove... Okay.

1472
01:38:04,269 --> 01:38:05,488
...personally. Yeah.

1473
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,448
Prepare for pain.

1474
01:38:09,622 --> 01:38:11,731
This guy must
not know who he’s dealing with.

1475
01:38:11,755 --> 01:38:13,409
Okay, cast toxic cloud.

1476
01:38:13,583 --> 01:38:15,463
I’m equipping the blackstone
armor. I’m going in.

1477
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:17,084
Oh, hey, you’re
coming on Saturday, right?

1478
01:38:17,108 --> 01:38:18,188
It’s a big birthday for me.

1479
01:38:18,283 --> 01:38:20,024
Yeah, man. Wait, it’s not...

1480
01:38:20,198 --> 01:38:21,634
it’s not at a biker bar, is it?

1481
01:38:21,808 --> 01:38:23,810
Aw, fuck
you.

1482
01:38:23,985 --> 01:38:26,074
Yeah, man, of course
I’m gonna be there.

1483
01:38:28,772 --> 01:38:30,513
Oh. Oh, shit!

1484
01:38:30,687 --> 01:38:32,447
Dude, just hold it for
a couple more minutes.

1485
01:38:32,515 --> 01:38:34,517
This guy’s almost dead.
No, dude, it’s not that.

1486
01:38:34,691 --> 01:38:36,519
I actually have to get
ready for that dinner.

1487
01:38:36,693 --> 01:38:39,217
Wow. You’re
ditching me to go on a date.

1488
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:41,480
I know, I know. It’s
very cute and adorable,

1489
01:38:41,654 --> 01:38:44,222
and I will make this up to you
later. Goodbye. Wait, wait, wait...

1490
01:38:47,878 --> 01:38:49,532
Hey, uh...

1491
01:38:49,706 --> 01:38:52,622
I can’t believe it’s been a
year since our first date.

1492
01:38:53,623 --> 01:38:54,754
I am...

1493
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:57,148
so happy I tried the pie.

1494
01:38:58,410 --> 01:38:59,411
Me too.

1495
01:39:00,369 --> 01:39:01,761
And, hey, you even
wore your tie.

1496
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,850
Yeah. You noticed.
Yeah.

1497
01:39:04,025 --> 01:39:05,722
It took the dry cleaners a while

1498
01:39:05,896 --> 01:39:08,812
to get the blood stains out, but,
um... you know, they managed.

1499
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:09,987
They did a good job.

1500
01:39:10,161 --> 01:39:11,510
Oh, wait, um...

1501
01:39:11,684 --> 01:39:12,990
Sorry, I almost forgot.

1502
01:39:18,474 --> 01:39:19,997
Oh, my God.

1503
01:39:21,868 --> 01:39:23,914
You finally figured
out the ending.

1504
01:39:24,088 --> 01:39:27,918
Felt kind of weird to have the
knight rescuing the damsel.

1505
01:39:28,092 --> 01:39:30,965
So I had them, you know,
kind of saving each other.

1506
01:39:32,227 --> 01:39:33,227
It’s perfect.

1507
01:39:34,446 --> 01:39:35,708
Hey!

1508
01:39:35,882 --> 01:39:37,188
Button that shirt up!

1509
01:39:37,362 --> 01:39:39,016
This ain’t no
conjugal visit, man.

1510
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:41,801
Oh, sorry. No, this isn’t like
a sex thing. This is, uh...

1511
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:44,239
Uh-huh?
Okay, yep. Got it.

1512
01:39:44,413 --> 01:39:46,458
And I know that’s not an
open flame I’m seeing.

1513
01:39:46,632 --> 01:39:47,633
Nope. It’s not.

1514
01:39:49,026 --> 01:39:51,159
Sorry.

1515
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:52,508
Don’t play with me.

1516
01:39:52,682 --> 01:39:53,746
I’m not trying to
play with you, sir.

1517
01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:54,770
Just shh.

1518
01:39:54,901 --> 01:39:56,077
Is he new?

1519
01:39:56,251 --> 01:39:57,295
Uh, no. He’s intense.

1520
01:39:57,469 --> 01:39:58,818
Yeah. He’s really intense.

1521
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:00,361
Yeah, they’re strict
here. It’s jail.

1522
01:40:00,385 --> 01:40:01,841
Inmate 241, time’s up.

1523
01:40:01,865 --> 01:40:04,389
That’s a tight 15
minutes, huh? Yeah.

1524
01:40:04,563 --> 01:40:07,784
At least we only have to put up
with it for another eight months.

1525
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:10,787
Yeah, seven months, 19
days, but who’s counting?

1526
01:40:12,484 --> 01:40:14,027
Don’t
make me come over there!

1527
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:16,290
You’re gonna get me in trouble.

1528
01:40:16,314 --> 01:40:17,359
I’m so sorry.

1529
01:40:17,533 --> 01:40:18,708
He’s so intense.

1530
01:40:18,882 --> 01:40:20,449
I know. I got to go. Okay.

1531
01:40:24,453 --> 01:40:26,716
I’ll, uh, see you soon...

1532
01:40:27,456 --> 01:40:28,457
Novocaine.
